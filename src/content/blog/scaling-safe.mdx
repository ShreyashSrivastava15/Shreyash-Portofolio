# Scaling S.A.F.E: The RoBERTa Engine

In this post, I detail the journey of integrating the RoBERTa model into the S.A.F.E. platform.

## Why RoBERTa?

Traditional rule-based systems often fail to catch subtle phishing attempts. RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) provides a deeper understanding of intent and context.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "roberta-base"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

## Impact

By moving to this model, we achieved:
- **94%+ Detection Accuracy**
- **Reduced False Positives** by 30%
